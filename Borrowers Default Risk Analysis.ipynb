    "\n",
    "This project is to prepare a report for the lending division of a bank. It is necessary to find out whether a customer's marital status and the number of children have an impact on whether he or she will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of customers.\n",

    "A **credit score** of the potential customer will be created for the report. The **credit score** is used to assess the ability of a potential borrower to repay his or her loan.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this work, 4 hypotheses will be evaluated, they are:\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between income level and on-time payment?\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between family status and on-time payment?\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between having children or not and on-time payment?\n",
    "- Is there a correlation with the purpose of the credit affecting the default rate?"
